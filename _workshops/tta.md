In the [MAT Workshop](https://tta-cvpr2024.github.io/), we aim to unite researchers on adaptation and robustness to push the boundaries between training and testing. Our focus is on updating during deployment to maintain or improve accuracy, calibration, and fairness on changing data in diverse settings. Our scope encompasses data, evaluation, algorithms, and unresolved challenges for test-time updates while emphasizing unsupervised adaptation with minimal computational overhead. Special attention will be given to inventive approaches for adapting foundation models to new data, tasks, and deployments.
