I am a PhD Student at the [University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/) and the [International Max Planck Research School (IMPRS) for Intelligent Systems (IS)](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/). I am co-supervised by [Oliver Bringmann](https://www.embedded.uni-tuebingen.de/team/oliver-bringmann/) and [Wieland Brendel](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=v-JL-hsAAAAJ). Before my PhD, I have obtained a B.Sc. and a M.Sc. in Physics at the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.kit.edu/english/index.php). During my Master's, I have participated in several research projects centered around numerical optics, and my Master thesis has been published at [Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13748-4).

During my PhD, I have been working on improving the **generalization capabilities of Deep Neural Networks** beyond their training distribution. I have explored how we can make vision models more robust to **distribution shifts**. Beyond investigating different robustification methods, I have also analyzed the benefits of **continual learning** when the model is allowed to adapt to the encountered distribution shifts.

In my recent works, I am trying to understand how the OOD generalization capabilities of popular foundation models trained on large-scale datasets can be benchmarked. I also find it intriguing to investigate how **multi-modality** affects the learned representations and their generalizability.

I have completed a research internship at FAIR under the guidance of [Ari Morcos](https://www.arimorcos.com/) and [Kamalika Chaudhuri](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~kamalika/). During that internship, I have been working on pruning of large-scale datasets for CLIP training. This work has been published at [ICLR 2024](https://openreview.net/forum?id=CtOA9aN8fr). I have also completed an internship as a student researcher at Google Deepmind under the guidance of [Olivier Hénaff](https://www.olivierhenaff.com/) as a member of the Active Learning team.

[**InfoNCE: Identifying the Gap Between Theory and Practice, AISTATS 2025**](https://openreview.net/forum?id=6ufuJl2XyE)\

We generalize previous identifiability results for contrastive learning toward anisotropic latents that better capture the effect of augmentations used in practical applications, thereby reducing the gap between theory and practice.

[**In Search of Forgotten Domain Generalization, ICLR 2025**](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Fk3eod9aaD)\
Prasanna Mayilvahanan\*, Roland S. Zimmermann\*, Thaddäus Wiedemer, <ins>Evgenia Rusak</ins>\, Attila Juhos, Matthias Bethge, Wieland Brendel

CLIP's high performance on style-centric domain shifts is significantly influenced by the presence of such images in its training set.
